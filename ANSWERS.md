- [x] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

        Class Components have state and lifecyles that are not in functional hooks.

- [x] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

        componentDidMount: After component is rendered this tells us if it loaded data. Can add event listeners.

        componentDidUpdate: Runs everytime component is updated. 
        
        render: returns JSX that is displayed in the UI. It can also return a null if there is nothing to render for that component.

- [x] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

        lets you extract component logic into reusable functions.

- [x] Why is it important to test our apps?

        Testing allows us to make sure our code has expected behavior.
